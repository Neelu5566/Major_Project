Hand Written Equation Solver

Description:
The equation solver should be able to handle a wide range of equations, including linear equations, quadratic equations, exponential equations etc.
The equation solver should take an equation as input and provide the solution(s) or roots of the equation as output. If the equation has multiple solutions or roots, the solver should return all possible solutions. The solver should also handle complex solutions for equations that involve complex numbers.The equation solver should be user-friendly and provide clear instructions for inputting equations. It should handle different formats of equations, such as standard mathematical notation, and be able to handle variables and constants.
The equation solver should provide accurate and precise solutions, taking into account the possible numerical errors associated with floating-point arithmetic. It should also handle any special cases or exceptions that may arise during the solving process, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
The equation solver should be efficient and provide solutions in a timely manner. It should avoid unnecessary computations and utilize appropriate algorithms and techniques for solving different types of equations.
Overall, the goal of the equation solver is to provide a versatile tool for solving mathematical equations, making it easier for users to obtain accurate solutions and explore various mathematical problems.

Installation:
1) Download this project and extract the folders and files. Open command prompt or terminal or vs code or whatever you use,
2) Type "npm install", it will install all node independencies what are required for this project.
3) Open another terminal or same terminal after the 2nd point completes, type "pip install requirements.txt", it will install all python packages which are used for this project.
4) run "python api.py" in one terminal and "node app.js" in another terminal, both are running consequently in terminals. If any of these terminals are not working then the project is not open in your desktop.

Usage:
It opens a localhost server in your web browser like the below picture but i am writing an equation in scribble whiteboard.

If it shows like above then you have to upload a multiple equations image in canvas (we are providing some images in Upload_Images folder) which is a button in navigation bar like below image.
